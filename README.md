## Definition of Done

Definition of done the user stories in general is the following:

- Tasks are completed
- Tests (unit tests and user story tests with Robot Framwork, coverage > 80%) are done and passed
- Code quality is on a good level (pylint > 8.0/10)
- Updated and working application is running on Heroku

## Installation and Running

To install the application you need a working Python and Poetry installation.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/secnec/ohtu-miniprojekti-2021.git
cd ohtu-miniprojekti-2021
poetry install
```

Before running the application you must set the database URL and the secret key to something unique for Flask. If you do not have a database installed, you can try to use `sqlite://`, which should create a database in-memory. Alternatively you can add a file called `.env`, which contains the necessary variables.

```bash
export DATABASE_URL=sqlite://
export SECRET_KEY=SetMeToSomethingSecret
```

To run the application from command line:

```bash
poetry run flask run
```

Alternatively:

```bash
poetry shell
flask run
```

The application is available in [Heroku](https://library-of-reading-tips.herokuapp.com/).

The application is available as a release on [Github](https://github.com/secnec/ohtu-miniprojekti-2021/releases/tag/0.1.0).

## Testing

To run unit tests locally

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

To get the coverage report for unit tests, in console or in html, locally

```bash
poetry run coverage run --branch -m pytest
poetry run covereage report -m
poetry run coverage html
```

To run user story tests with Robot Framework locally

```bash
poetry shell
robot tips_app/tests
```

Please make sure you have the application open at the time of running the robot tests.
